/**
 * Frame classification for the Android client (feature 044).
 *
 * Every server->client WS frame type in the committed UI-protocol manifest
 * (`contracts/ui_protocol.json`) is classified as either [HANDLED] (the
 * reducer consumes it) or [IGNORED] (a deliberate, logged drop recorded in the
 * parity matrix). There is no third state: `ProtocolManifestTest` asserts this
 * table covers the manifest exactly, so a new server frame type fails the build
 * until it is classified — never a silent drop (FR-001/FR-002/FR-023).
