"""Frame classification for the desktop client (feature 044).

Every server->client WS frame type in the committed UI-protocol manifest
(``contracts/ui_protocol.json``) is classified here as either

* ``"handled"`` — the client routes it in ``MainWindow._on_message``; or
* ``"ignored"`` — a deliberate, logged drop (the frame carries nothing the
  desktop presents natively; the parity matrix records why).

There is no third state. ``tests/test_protocol_manifest.py`` asserts this table
covers the manifest exactly, so a new server frame type fails the build until it
is classified — never a silent drop (FR-001/FR-002/FR-023).

HANDLED = "handled"

#: ui_event actions handled entirely in-app (never sent for a server
#: ``chrome_surface`` re-render), so a surface's load-timeout bound must NOT be
#: armed for them. Committed mirror of ``contracts/ui_protocol.json``
#: ``client_local_actions`` — a packaged build has no repo tree to probe, so
#: the value lives here and ``tests/test_protocol_manifest.py`` asserts the two
#: stay in sync.
