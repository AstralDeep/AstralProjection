"""Feature 027 — static User-guide content for the ``guide`` chrome surface.

Ported from the former React panel
(``frontend/src/components/guide/UserGuidePanel.tsx`` at commit ``29de624``).
Every section of the source panel is carried over; wording that described
React-era chrome that no longer exists (the left sidebar, draggable floating
chat, URL-persisted filters, instant-save permissions) is adapted to the
current server-rendered UI (top-bar Settings menu, fixed chat panel,
explicit-save surfaces).

The guide is intentionally static content (no live data, no DB access).
``SECTIONS`` is an ordered list of ``{"slug", "title", "body_html"}`` dicts
(the admin section additionally carries ``"admin_only": True``). ``body_html``
is built exclusively from the literal strings below via the escape-by-default
helpers in this module — all plain text passes through ``esc()``; only the
helpers themselves emit markup.
